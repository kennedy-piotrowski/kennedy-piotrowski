Hello World, Iâ€™m @kennedy-piotrowski.
I am a college student intereseted in CS and Engineering.
I am currently at very beginner levels, but looking to expand my coding skills!
My coding classes so far have covered some Python and C. 
I like to be artsy so I am looking for ways to teach me to code that I can use my artistic skills in as well!
I would like to use GitHub as a way to track progression and work with others!
That's it for now!
Have a good one world! :)
